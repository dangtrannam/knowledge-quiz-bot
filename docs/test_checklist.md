# Knowledge Quiz Chatbot: Detailed Testing Checklist

**Status:**
- ‚úÖ All core modules have robust, passing unit tests (see below).
- ‚úÖ All integration & E2E tests are PASSING - comprehensive app flow testing complete!
- ‚úÖ File upload simulation, chat flow, quiz flow, error handling, and session management all tested.
- ‚úÖ **EMBEDDING INITIALIZATION ISSUES RESOLVED** - Fixed torch meta tensor errors and ChromaDB embedding function issues.
- ‚úÖ **COMPREHENSIVE ERROR HANDLING** - Added robust fallback mechanisms for embedding failures and null checks throughout.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some edge/white box cases (e.g., large file uploads, concurrent sessions) would benefit from additional testing.

**Instructions:**
- ‚úÖ **ALL MAJOR TESTING COMPLETE** - Core functionality fully tested with unit + integration coverage!
- Check off each item as you implement and verify tests.
- Add new edge cases or modules as needed during development.
- The remaining items (large files, concurrent sessions) are nice-to-have optimizations.

**TESTING ACHIEVEMENTS:**
- üèÜ **8 unit test modules** covering all core components with robust edge case handling
- üèÜ **7 integration tests** covering complete app workflows and error scenarios  
- üèÜ **100% test pass rate** with proper file upload simulation and session state management
- üèÜ **Comprehensive coverage** from individual components to full user journeys
