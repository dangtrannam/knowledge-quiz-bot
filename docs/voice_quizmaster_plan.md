# Voice Quizmaster Feature Plan

## Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core TTS Integration
- **Scope:**
  - Select and integrate a TTS library (e.g., pyttsx3, gTTS).
  - Implement basic TTS utility functions (e.g., `speak(text)`, `stop()`).
  - Trigger TTS to read out quiz questions and answers at the appropriate points in the quiz flow.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Working TTS output for quiz content.
  - Documentation on how to enable/disable TTS in code.

### Phase 2: User Controls & UI Integration
- **Scope:**
  - Add user-facing controls to enable/disable TTS.
  - Implement playback controls (play, pause, repeat).
  - Provide visual/audio feedback for TTS status (playing, paused, error).
- **Deliverables:**
  - UI elements for TTS control.
  - User can interactively control TTS during the quiz.

### Phase 3: Accessibility & Configuration
- **Scope:**
  - Ensure all TTS controls are accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers).
  - Add configuration options for TTS in user settings.
  - Provide fallback for users who do not use audio.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Accessible TTS controls.
  - Configurable TTS settings.

### Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Scope:**
  - Test TTS functionality across all supported platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
  - Test with various question/answer types and edge cases.
  - Test accessibility features.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Test reports and bug fixes.
  - Verified cross-platform and accessible TTS experience.

### Phase 5: Advanced Features & Enhancements
- **Scope:**
  - Add multilingual support.
  - Allow users to select different voices.
  - Integrate speech-to-text for full voice interaction (optional/future work).
- **Deliverables:**
  - Enhanced TTS features (language, voice selection).
  - Optional voice input for answers.

## Overview
The Voice Quizmaster feature will enable the chatbot to read out quiz questions and answer options using text-to-speech (TTS) technology. This will improve accessibility and engagement, especially for visually impaired users or those who prefer audio interaction.

---

## 1. Clarify Requirements & User Experience
- **Feature Description:**
  - The chatbot reads quiz questions and answer options aloud.
  - Users can enable/disable TTS and control playback (play, pause, repeat).
  - The feature should be non-intrusive and easy to use.
- **Target Users:**
  - Users who benefit from audio (e.g., visually impaired, multitaskers).
  - All users seeking a more engaging quiz experience.

---

## 2. Technical Requirements
- **TTS Library/API:**
  - Evaluate options: `pyttsx3`, `gTTS`, cloud APIs (Google, AWS, Azure).
  - Consider voice quality, language support, ease of integration, and licensing.
- **Integration Points:**
  - Where questions/answers are generated and presented.
  - How/when to trigger TTS output.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
  - Ensure the solution works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

---

## 3. User Interface/Experience Design
- **Controls:**
  - Toggle to enable/disable TTS.
  - Buttons for play, pause, repeat.
- **Feedback:**
  - Indicate audio status (playing, paused, error).
- **Accessibility:**
  - Ensure all controls are keyboard accessible.
  - Provide fallback for users who do not use audio.

---

## 4. Integration Points in Codebase
- **Quiz Flow:**
  - Identify where questions and answers are shown to the user.
  - Insert TTS triggers at these points.
- **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous:**
  - Decide if TTS should block further input or run in the background.

---

## 5. Library/API Selection
- **Evaluation Criteria:**
  - Voice quality and naturalness.
  - Language and accent support.
  - Local vs. cloud-based (privacy, latency, cost).
  - Ease of use and maintenance.
- **Decision:**
  - Select the best fit for the project and document the rationale.

---

## 6. Implementation Steps
1. **Add TTS Utility Functions**
   - Create a module for TTS operations (e.g., `ui/tts_utils.py`).
   - Functions: `speak(text)`, `stop()`, `pause()`, `resume()`.
2. **Integrate TTS into Quiz Flow**
   - Call TTS functions when presenting questions/answers.
   - Handle user controls for playback.
3. **Update UI**
   - Add controls for TTS (toggle, play, pause, repeat).
   - Display audio status.
4. **Configuration**
   - Allow users to enable/disable TTS in settings or via a toggle.
5. **Testing**
   - Test on all supported platforms.
   - Test with various question/answer types and edge cases.
   - Test accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers).

---

## 7. Challenges & Mitigation
- **TTS Latency:**
  - Preload or cache audio where possible.
- **Compatibility:**
  - Test on all target platforms and document any limitations.
- **Audio Overlap/Interruptions:**
  - Ensure only one audio stream plays at a time; handle interruptions gracefully.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Provide clear messages if TTS fails.
- **Privacy & Accessibility:**
  - Avoid sending sensitive data to cloud TTS services unless necessary.
  - Ensure all users can access quiz content regardless of TTS usage.

---

## 8. Future Enhancements
- **Multilingual Support:**
  - Add support for multiple languages/accents.
- **Voice Customization:**
  - Allow users to select different voices.
- **Full Voice Interaction:**
  - Integrate speech-to-text for spoken answers.
