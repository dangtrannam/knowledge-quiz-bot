## E2E Testing Plan: Playwright (UI/Browser Automation)

**Goal:**
- Prevent runtime UI/session state errors (e.g., Streamlit key collisions, widget/session state mismatches, unhandled exceptions)
- Validate all critical user flows and error handling in a real browser environment

### Playwright E2E Test Coverage

- [ ] **App Launch & Smoke Test**
  - Launch app, verify no uncaught exceptions or Streamlit errors in UI
  - Check for presence of main UI elements (sidebar, chat, quiz, upload)

- [ ] **Widget/Session State Collision Detection**
  - Interact with all sidebar widgets (provider/model/API key inputs)
  - Change provider/model, verify no Streamlit session state errors appear
  - Attempt to trigger known collision scenarios (e.g., set widget and session state with same key)
  - Assert no StreamlitAPIException is shown in UI

- [ ] **File Upload & Document Processing**
  - Upload valid PDF, TXT, DOCX files
  - Upload large file (>10MB) and verify processing or error message
  - Upload invalid/corrupt file, verify graceful error

- [ ] **Chat Flow**
  - Enter user message, select documents, submit
  - Verify LLM response is shown, no UI errors
  - Test with missing/invalid API key, verify error message
  - Test with empty knowledge base, verify error message

- [ ] **Quiz Flow**
  - Start quiz, answer questions, submit answers
  - Verify scoring, feedback, and no UI errors
  - Test adaptive difficulty and edge cases (no context, LLM failure)

- [ ] **Session State & Mode Switching**
  - Switch between chat and quiz modes repeatedly
  - Upload new files, switch modes, verify state is preserved and no errors
  - Simulate concurrent sessions (multiple browser tabs)

- [ ] **Error Handling & Recovery**
  - Simulate network/API failures (disconnect, invalid endpoint)
  - Remove/revoke API key mid-session, verify error handling
  - Trigger LLM/embedding/model errors, verify fallback UI

- [ ] **UI Consistency & Regression**
  - Check for UI regressions after code changes (visual snapshots)
  - Verify all buttons, inputs, and outputs are present and functional

### Playwright Implementation Notes
- Use Playwright's test runner for parallel browser sessions
- Use selectors for all critical UI elements (sidebar, chat input, quiz controls)
- Capture and assert on browser console errors (fail test if StreamlitAPIException or uncaught error appears)
- Use Playwright's screenshot and trace features for debugging failures
- Integrate E2E tests into CI pipeline for every PR/merge
