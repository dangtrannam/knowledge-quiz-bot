    Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
    
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.
    
    Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following pre-programmed instructions, ML algorithms build mathematical models based on training data to make predictions or decisions.
    
    Types of Machine Learning:
    1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Examples include classification and regression tasks.
    2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.
    3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through interaction with an environment using rewards and penalties. Examples include game playing and robotics.
    
    Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers. It has been particularly successful in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.
    
    Neural networks are inspired by the human brain and consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information. Each connection has a weight that determines the strength of the signal passed between neurons.
    
    Applications of AI include autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, fraud detection, recommendation systems, virtual assistants, and many more domains that continue to expand as the technology advances.

    Python Programming Fundamentals
    
    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
    
    Key Features of Python:
    1. Easy to Learn: Python has a simple syntax that resembles natural language
    2. Interpreted: Code is executed line by line, making debugging easier
    3. Object-Oriented: Supports object-oriented programming paradigms
    4. Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other operating systems
    5. Extensive Libraries: Rich standard library and third-party packages
    
    Data Types in Python:
    - Integers: Whole numbers (int)
    - Floats: Decimal numbers (float)
    - Strings: Text data (str)
    - Booleans: True/False values (bool)
    - Lists: Ordered, mutable collections
    - Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections
    - Dictionaries: Key-value pairs
    - Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements
    
    Control Structures:
    - if/elif/else statements for conditional execution
    - for loops for iterating over sequences
    - while loops for repeated execution based on conditions
    - try/except blocks for error handling
    
    Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They are defined using the 'def' keyword and can accept parameters and return values.
    
    Python is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and scientific computing.
